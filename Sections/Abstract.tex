%\anindya{Changed the context. Please check.}
Software development is complicated with rapidly changing requirements, techniques, processes and 
the involvement of diverse stakeholders (clients, developers, testers, managements, and so on). 
It is often the case a burgeoning community shapes around the emergence of a software industry 
in a location (e.g., silicon valley) or in a country. Therefore, 
a study on the software development practice in the industry of a country
reveals the challenges and scopes of improvement for that industry and
industries of similar types. There are several studies on the software industry
of countries with an established reputation as a software manufacturer. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there is no recent study that explores the issues
and achievements of an emerging software industry. 
% The software engineering industry in Bangladesh offers a rapidly emerging
% environment and significantly contributes to the national economy. A thorough
% study to understand the software development practices is essential to figure
% out the challenges and opportunities to deliver high-quality software.
\newline \textbf{Objective:} In this research, we focus on
the picture of such industries and selected Bangladesh, which is an emerging developing country with a 
large group of skilled software practitioners. We have two objectives. First, we aim to understand the methods and practices used
in the dynamic environment of software development, what technologies and tools
the professionals utilize, how practitioners assure the quality of products, and
maintain software security and performance. Second, we aim  to understand whether and how the development practices 
and methods in Bangladesh differ from other countries. The comparison will inform us of the 
uniqueness of software industries in emerging countries like Bangladesh.
\newline \textbf{Method:} In this study, we have conducted interview sessions
and a survey. We have interviewed 8 individual participants from 4 leading
software companies to reduce ambiguity of the survey questions. Then we have
conducted an online survey and received 137 responses from a diverse set of
developers who are currently working in the software industry of Bangladesh.
\newline \textbf{Results:} The major findings of our study on the companies of
Bangladesh software industry are: i) Most companies follow the agile methodology
and give implementation-related activities a high priority, ii) Most companies
are used to developing web-based software products, iii) Most companies use less
automated testing and deployment tools, and iv) Several companies seriously
consider the security, performance, and scalability of their software.
\newline \textbf{Conclusion:} We hope that the outcome of our study will help
the software industry of Bangladesh and similar countries formally understand
the shortcomings compared to established industries and also help different
stakeholders intervene accordingly. The students can prepare themselves to face
the challenges of the industry in an informed way.
