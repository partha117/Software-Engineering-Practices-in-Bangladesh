This study identifies the general practices, obstacles, and requirements of the software development industry in Bangladesh. Here we explored the common practices and shortcomings in the emerging industry. It was revealed that testing and automated testing are quite low compared to the established software industry. Although we have found that software security consciousness is higher than other emerging software industries, security testing practices, and standards lag behind other countries. We have noticed the low participation of women in the software industry. Further research may be conducted to determine any biases or barriers for women in the SE industry. These findings can help developers, industry owners, and academia work to better the industry from their own position and perspective.
