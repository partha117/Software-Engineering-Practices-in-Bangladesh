To have a vibrant SE industry and to maintain a steady workforce for the industry it is important that universities meet the expectation from the industry. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:university expectation}, industry owners/experts expect emphasis on SE basic and on current trends, they also seek for the opportunity to collaborate with the universities. The result coincides with  a study conducted by Radermacher et al. \citep{Radermacher2013}. According to their study, SE basic (Project Management, Software Tools, Testing) is the second area where graduate students are deficient in knowledge\citep{Radermacher2013}. Though behavioral skill or soft skill enables faster integration and happier teams only 2.19\% respondents emphasize on inclusion of behavioral skill in syllabus, the scenario is quite different in New Zealand. In a survey conducted by Stevens et al.\citep{Stevens2016} it is found that industry experts emphasize on behavioral skills after technical skill. They also found that those skills are un-trainable in work place. Thus it is the duty of university to train graduates with required skill set.
\begin{enumerate}
    
    
    \item \textbf{Inclusion of behavioral skill in Syllabus}: Being a good coder is difficult, but being a good human being is much more difficult. In industry, a person has to meet a large variety of personalities, and only a well behaved individual will find it easy to work with them. About 2.19\% people have implied about it.
    \surveyquote{Teach students Professional Ethics and Practices, Tie-up with Industry Practices and Problems, Solutions or Research Paper for any specific or generic Technical/Administrative problems}{108}
    
    
    
    \item \textbf{Syllabus based on industry trend}:It is seen in some universities in our country that they are teaching on a syllabus which was designed a very very long time ago. Since then software industry has advanced a long way. 6.57\% of our respondents think that these age-old academic curriculum should be changed and new latest topic should be added.
    \surveyquote{Concentrate on applied science with theory. Change syllabus based on current trend each year. Apply internship to relevant organisations}{5}
    
    
    
    \item \textbf{Opportunity to work with industry}:  As many students will be joining the industry after graduation, it will be very convenient for everyone if they are acquainted with the industry in their varsity life. 5.84\% respondents have felt the necessity of industry-academia correlation.
    \surveyquote{Create opportunities to work with industry solving the problems we are facing in the industry. Sometimes we are so busy with developing features that we lack the opportunity to run some researches about our tasks. University projects can be subjected to s...}{10}

    \surveyquote{University should train student some basic knowledge of industry practice. Research on industry SDLC.}{115}
    
    
    
    \item \textbf{Developing mindset of students}: To have a keen interest to learn new technological knowledge is a must for every students. This mindset will not be developed in a day. They have to practise it for a long time. 3.65\% respondents feel that teachers as well as universities can help them to achieve it.
    \surveyquote{Develop mind set of student so that they love challenges, enjoy taking initiatives , never fear a problem and always ready to learn. It should teach students basic behavioral skills like honesty, integrity, accept failure and criticism positively , respect...}{35}
    
    
    
    \item \textbf{Use of professional tools}: 2.92\% respondents expects that university should make their student acquainted with professional software engineering tools like version controlling system, testing suits etc.
    \surveyquote{They should introduce students to version controlling. Code quality can be also an important thing}{57}

Government policies shapes the future SE industry. Tessler et al.\citep{Tessler2003} completed a study to rank the possible action for government for boosting the IT industry. They have ranked infrastructure and telecommunication as the first two action for government. The result is similar to our study where the 7.3\% respondents  expects  better infrastructure from government.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Online and free training}: If government arranges free and online training, the professionals can learn a lot more alongside with the private training. 2.19\% of our respondents have demanded for free online workshop.
    \surveyquote{1.online Free training center for easy learning it from Advance level (industry level) , Not basic level}{128}
    
    \item\textbf{More research fund}: In our country, research funds issued by government is really really less than expected. If we want to emerge as a country of developed software industry, government have to issue more money on research on this sector. 5.84\% respondents think that it is very hard to develop software industry with such little funds.
    \surveyquote{Issuing research funds to the universities to run researches. Government should emphasize in automation in every possible sector}{10}
    
    \item\textbf{More investment in IT}: 4.38\% respondents wants more investment  in IT sector from the govern met. Respondents mention steps like tax waiver and creating opportunities for domestic companies in government projects.
    \surveyquote{Tax benefits, infrastructure}{66}
    
    \item\textbf{Less bureaucracy}: 2.19\% of respondents want the removal of red tape from the administrative process as it prevents the development of the IT industry.
    \surveyquote{get yourself out of corruption. and let yourself put in liability}{133}
    
    \item\textbf{Distribution of project based on skill}: It is frequently seen in our country that less expert and less eligible persons are getting priority than more eligible persons because of nepotism. 2.92\% of our respondents think that it should be eliminated as soon as possible for the sake of industry development.
    \surveyquote{Proper maintenance with previous projects and follow up. Plan next years with long vision through solid IT-specialists. Distribute projects based on skills than links. Remove bureaucratic process for small companies to contribute more for country}{5}
    
    \item\textbf{Cheaper internet}: In this age, it is difficult to spend a single day without internet. As it is also a great source of learning as well as earning, government should remove tax from internet charge and give internet in exchange of a very lower rate. Some people have also asked for 5G.
    \surveyquote{faster and cheaper internet infrastructure}{74}
    
    \item\textbf{Advanced infrastructure}: 7.3\% respondents expects advanced infrastructure like IT/software parks, data center from government.

In order to adapt to the new technologies and drive new employees, staff training sessions are required in SE firms. From the survey, it is clear that in house training is the most popular form of training in the SE industry in Bangladesh. In the Australian \citep{Ng2004} and Hong Kong\citep{Chan2005} SE industry , the scenario is different where the most popular form of training is commercial courses and then in house training.  The difference in popularity can be linked to economic conditions. As the SE industry of Bangladesh is not mature, it is clear that SE companies will not be able to spend money on paid training courses.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Using paid resources}: 4.38\% respondents mentioned that they use online paid resources or certification courses to train their employees.
    \surveyquote{We have pluralsight account and we perform bimonthly technical session}{57}
    
    \item\textbf{Supervision of seniors}: Being supervised by the seniors is the best way of training. They can teach us from their experience and experience teaches a lot.
    \surveyquote{mentoring}{74}
    
    \item\textbf{Runtime training}: About 7.3\% people have said that they provide their employees with runtime training.
    \surveyquote{Run time training through small scale project and supervision of seniors}{5}
    
    \item\textbf{In house training}: Companies also provide their employees with tutorials and books so that they can read at their home and get used to the practices followed.
