\label{conclusion}

This study identifies the general practices, obstacles, and requirements of the emerging SE industry in Bangladesh. We have identified that the current industry trend is not so prevalent in Bangladesh; testing and automated testing are quite low compared to the established SE industry. Although we have found that software security consciousness is higher than other emerging SE industries, security testing practices, and standards lag behind other countries. Our research finds that an automated testing framework for all types of testing can enhance developers' automated testing practices. We have noticed the low participation of women in the SE industry. Further research may be conducted to determine any biases or barriers for women in the SE industry. We believe that our research has identified common practices and problems in the Bangladesh SE industry. These findings can help developers, industry owners, and academia to fit the global market better.
