(1) Agile and scrum are the two most used methods for development. (2) Appreciable respondents answered that plain text and storyboard for requirements gathering, which shows that tools for requirements collection yet are not used usually in Bangladesh. (3) The implementation stage gets more preference than system design, planning, and testing in Bangladesh.

We have perceived that in the Bangladesh SE industry, there exists an ad-hoc based software development practice which might be similar to the practices in Malaysia nonetheless, the regions like Japan, Europe, etc., give more importance to system planning and design that makes those region-specific SE industries more stable.
