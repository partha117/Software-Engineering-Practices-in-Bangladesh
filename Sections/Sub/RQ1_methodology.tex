\subsubsection{What software methodology are used in your project?}
\label{methodology}
Software development methodology in software engineering is a framework that is used to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way. To find out the overall answer of this question, we report the following results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Software development methodologies (Q 6).
\item Requirements gathering (Q 7).
\item Most time consuming software development activities (Q 8).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Software development methodologies}
The most-widely used model is Agile with usage rate of 64\%. The next widely-used model is scrum with usage rates of 46\%. The other methodologies has lower usage rates, namely: pair programming (20\%), Waterfall (12\%) etc.

\paragraph{Requirements Gathering}
The most critical activity that always arises during software development is the collecting requirement of the proposed system. According to \ref{fig:requirements}, using plain text (44\%) and story board (41\%) are the most widely used requirements gathering. The other requirements gathering usage rates are: Use case (36\%), GUI prototype (35\%), grooming session (30\%) etc. This is an important finding that requires further analysis for causes and to analyze the potential effects of not documenting requirements.

\paragraph{Development activities timeline}
In this section participants were asked about the most time consuming software developing activities they had spend. As we see in \ref{fig:activities}, most of the time spent in implementation stage according to 65\% our respondents and requirement analysis stage requires second most according to 45\% response. The other usages are: Program design (37\%), project planning (30\%), testing (19\%), maintenance (17\%) etc.
