% Agenda1: Hussain reported female got only SQA role and there may be bias
% Agenda 2 Male senior
% Agenda 3 Experience, software category age dev method ( female less interested in team work) should prefer agile
In our survey, 90.1\% of participants were male, and 9.9\% participants were female. It is often said that females are less represented in STEM. As the SE industry is directly related to STEM, the claim may be true in the SE industry. Though our survey does not represent the real scenario, the proportion of male and female participants supports the claim of underrepresentation. To get an overview of the Bangladesh SE industry by gender in Figure \ref{fig:gender and role}, we plotted the participants' roles grouped by gender.

In terms of roles, the proportion of developers among female participants is comparatively low than that of male participants. However, the scenario is the opposite of the manager and team lead role. Generally, the developer role is considered a junior role, and the manager/team lead is considered a senior role. Thus, it is clear from Figure \ref{fig:gender and role} that there is a difference between junior and senior roles among female participants. This indicates that in recent years females are less interested in joining the SE industry. Also, among ten different roles, female participants are holding only four types of roles.  Our findings align with the survey result of Hussain et al.\cite{Hussain2020}. They found that female participants are only limited to developer, QA, and project manager roles where male participants are holding varying types of roles in the Bangladesh SE industry.

\input{Tables/Analysis_by_Gender}

The interesting findings of gender analysis are presented in Table \ref{table:analysis by gender}. James et al.'s\cite{James2017} survey on male and female software professionals found that men are more likely to be in senior positions than women. In Q4 of Table \ref{table:analysis by gender}, we observe a similar scenario. However, in our case, the observation is not statistically significant. They also found that male software practitioners tend to be older than female practitioners and female practitioners tend to leave jobs in mid-career. We observe the same phenomena in Q2 and Q4, and the finding may be true in Bangladesh.


James et al.\cite{James2017} found that express less satisfaction with the spirit of teamwork inside the organization. They conclude that this characteristic would make female practitioners a key part of a good agile team. Our findings align with James et al\cite{James2017}. In Q6  of Table \ref{table:analysis by gender}, we observe that our survey's female participants prefer the Agile methodology to other software development methodologies. 

In James et al.'s survey, neither male nor female was not dominating any particular technology field. However, in Q9 of 
Table \ref{table:analysis by gender} we observe female participants working on desktop, web, and mobile. As a small SE industry, cloud/IoT is considered a less secured field as job opportunities in these fields are small. It seems female participants tend to work in more secure technology (in terms of a job opportunity) field.
