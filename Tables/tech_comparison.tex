(1) Majority of our participants were related to the various types of web-based applications that convey the market demand for web-based apps in Bangladesh. (2) Linux is mainly used for development purposes while macOS is highly preferred by managers. (3) Javascript and Java are two mostly used programming languages in the Bangladesh SE industry since the demand for web-based services as well as mobile apps.
