\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Thanks to the results of this survey, we have observed that software industry in Bangladesh is
spirited, growing and competitive that many software teams are eager for adopting state-of-theart software engineering practices and approaches.Awareness and knowledge about these practices and approaches are rising in the industry, that many organizations have been establishing
them within their development operations. We have also observed that the industry needs to
improve on using well-established requirements engineering and testing related practices.These
two areas are where most displeasure is stated about. Also we observed that practitioners have
a tendency to avoid formal or relatively complex best practices (e.g.TDD, formal languages,
pair programming, automation testing and metric usage) in general, but especially in these two
areas. We suggest organizations to invest in improvement and training efforts for increasing
the awareness and knowledge about these software disciplines.In this study, we have seen that
social aspects are important as well that many practitioners have expressed their discontent and
difficulties on issues like communication, collaboration, and team structure.
