    D1 & Scrum and waterfall \citep{Wang2018,Garousi2015} are the most used development methods. Though requirements are specified in text format in the Netherland~\citep{Vonken2012}, well-specified design documentations are practiced in Japan and Europe\citep{Cusumano2003}. & Like Malaysia an ad-hoc based software development practice exists in Bangladesh. Advanced industries give high importance to planning. However, in Bangladesh, implementation phase gets the highest priority. \\ \hline
    
    
    D2 & Web (as tech platform) and Windows (as OS) are the dominating platform in New Zealand~\citep{Wang2018}. Although Java is a popular language in Turkey~\citep{Garousi2015}, it is not that much popular in New Zealand~\citep{Wang2018} &  Like other countries web-based platforms have widespread demand in Bangladesh. Bangladesh SE industry has similarity with Turkey in terms of popularity of Java and Python. \\ \hline
    
    
    D3 & Unit testing is highly practiced in technologically advanced SE industries~\citep{Garousi2013, Wang2018}. However, the level of test automation is not satisfactory in the European SE industry~\citep{dutta1999}. & In Bangladesh, unit testing is less extensive than the advanced SE industry practice. However, in test automation it has similarity with the European SE industry.\\ \hline
    
    D4 & Though it is a common practice in advance industries security~\citep{Garousi2015, Farvin2016, Bahl2011, Sung2006} and performance testing~\citep{Garousi2013,Garousi2015,Phillips2003} are less prevalent in emerging SE industries~\citep{Jahan2019}. &  Though Bangladesh has similarities with emerging industries in terms of security testing, `no security' is less prevalent in Bangladesh.\\ \hline
