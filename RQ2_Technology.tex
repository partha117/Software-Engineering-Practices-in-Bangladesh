\subsubsection{Which implementation technologies and tools are adopted by software development professionals?}

To find out the overall comparison of this section, we report the following sub-sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Technology Platform (Q9).
\item Operating System (Q10).
\item Programming Language (Q11).
\end{itemize}

We have compared our study findings on these sub-topics to get similarities and dissimilarities with the countries like Turkey, New Zealand, etc., on which a couple of relevant studies have been conducted. We compare the major findings of our study with the similar findings of previous studies in Table \ref{table:tech_comparison}.

\input{Tables/tech_comparison}

\paragraph{Technology Platforms}
As shown in \ref{fig:platforms}, most of our survey respondents (80\%) work in web platforms. This outcome is similar to the result of the survey of Wang et al. \cite{Wang2018} in which the authors found that most of their respondents also develop in web platforms in New Zealand.


\paragraph{Operating Systems}
We have found an interesting point that Windows is mostly used among developers of New Zealand based on the study \cite{Wang2018} nevertheless, Linux is mostly used in the case for Bangladeshi developers corresponding to our survey presented in \ref{fig:os}.


\paragraph{Programming Languages}
According to the study of Wang et al.\cite{Wang2018}, Java ranks quite low in New Zealand; nevertheless, it is the second most used programming language in Bangladesh as per our study reported in \ref{fig:languages} as well as the most used language in Turkey \cite{Garousi2015}. Again, Python did not have a good standing in the ranking of languages used in New Zealand; nevertheless, it is used significantly in Bangladesh.
