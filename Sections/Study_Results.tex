% \section{Study Results}
% \subsection{Development Practices and Processes in Bangladesh (RQ1)}
% We divide this into four sub-questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item What software methodology are used in your project?
%     \item Which implementation technologies and tools are adopted by software
% development professionals?
% \item  What type of testing and deployment practices are used?
% \item How are the security and performance is ensured in a product of a company?
% \end{enumerate}
% \subsection{Comparison among countries (RQ2)}
% We do the comparison along the following dimensions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Development methods and practices
%     \item Implementation technologies
%     \item Quality assurance
%     \item Release and iterations
% \end{enumerate}



We have divided our study results in two question. For the first question, we will discuss about the dimensions of software development practices and processes in Bangladesh in detail. Then for the next question, we will compare those dimensions of Bangladesh with other regions to see similarities and dissimilarities in practicing software development methodologies and technologies.

\subsection{Development Practices and Processes in Bangladesh (RQ1)}
\label{RQ1}

We divide this into following four sub-questions which examine software development practices and processes in Bangladesh in more detail.

\subsection{Comparison among countries (RQ2)}
\label{RQ2}

In this section, we present a comparative discussion on different dimensions of software development practices and processes among different regions of the world along with Bangladesh. We do the comparison along the following dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Development methods and practices
    \item Implementation technologies
    \item Quality assurance
    \item Release and iterations
\end{itemize}

The following subsections describe these dimensions.
