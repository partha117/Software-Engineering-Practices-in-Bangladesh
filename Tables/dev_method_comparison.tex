(2) Tools for requirements collection yet are not used usually in Bangladesh. (3) The implementation is more prioritized than planning, and testing.} &  Scrum and waterfall \citep{Wang2018,Garousi2015} are mostly used as development method.            & \multirow{3}{=}{Similar to the practices in Malaysia an ad-hoc based software development practice exists in Bangladesh SE industry. Regions like Japan, Europe, etc., give more importance to system planning and design that makes those region-specific SE industries more stable.} \\ \cline{3-3}
