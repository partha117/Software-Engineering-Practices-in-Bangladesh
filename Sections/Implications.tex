\section{Implication}
\label{implications}
Thus far, we have discussed the SE practices of Bangladesh similarity and dissimilarity with both established and emerging SE industries. In this section, we discuss the implications of our findings. As well as helping the researcher to understand SE challenges in the emerging software industry, our study can also help industry leaders, software practitioners, universities, and open source development.

\indent \textbf{Researchers:} In this study, we have identified that females are underrepresented in the Bangladesh SE industry. Hussain et al.\cite{Hussain2020} expressed a concern that there may be bias in the hiring process of the industry. Also, it appears that nowadays, females are less interested in joining the SE industry. Further research may be conducted to identify the inherent reason behind these facts. We have also found that testing has been given less priority in the industry though it is one of the key elements for software QA. Furthermore, automatic testing, which is crucial for productivity, and automatic deployment/release, is mostly done in unit testing. An automatic testing framework for other types of testing (such as GUI testing) may increase automatic testing practice. Researchers may work to create a framework to implement automatic testing in all types of testing. We have found that certain development methods are popular with a particular group (agile in females). Further study may be conducted to investigate the problems associated with incorporating other development methods in those groups. Containerization technologies are a popular trend worldwide. However, the practice of containerization technologies is too low. Researchers can investigate the challenges to incorporate this technology in an emerging SE industry like Bangladesh.

\indent \textbf{Software Practitioners:}  We have found that rigorous testing practice is not prevalent in Bangladesh. The difference in testing effort between established SE industry (e.g., Canada) and Bangladesh is too high. The scenario is also true for other emerging SE industry like Pakistan. From our study, software practitioners may have an idea of their standing in software QA in terms of testing. Similar to all emerging industries, security testing is less prioritized in Bangladesh. From our comparison, developers may better understand security testing and security practices in other countries. Moreover, we have shown the level of automatic testing in the Bangladesh SE industry. Automatic testing is directly related to productivity. Practitioners can increase their productivity by implementing automatic testing in their products.

\indent \textbf{Universities:} We have found that certain languages (e.g., Java, Javascript, etc.) and frameworks (e.g., Spring, Django, ASP.NET) has demand in the Bangladesh SE industry. Universities can update their curricula to meet industry demand. We have also found less testing practice in the Bangladesh SE industry. This may be related to a lack of knowledge regarding the testing framework. Similar to  Hussain et al.\cite{Hussain2020}, we also suggest including testing-related courses into the curriculum of universities.


\indent \textbf{Industry Leaders:} This study found that the Bangladesh SE industry lags in adopting current industry trends. Thus Bangladesh can be a good marketplace for cloud companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Moreover, we have found most of the participants in our study are engaged in web technology. This may indicate that the web is the most popular form among users of Bangladesh. This observation can help the industry owners to select appropriate medium while targeting users of this region. We have identified common practices of the practitioners of the Bangladesh SE industry.


\indent \textbf{Emerging Software Industries:} We have identified some practices in Bangladesh, which are also applicable to other emerging SE industries. We have seen that testing is given less priority in the emerging SE industry than in the established SE industry. Rigorous testing practices can help these industries be on par with others in global competition.
