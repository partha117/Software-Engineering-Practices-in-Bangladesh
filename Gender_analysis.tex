\bf{In our survey, 90.1\% of participants were male, and 9.9\% participants were
female, which is slightly better than the Stack Overflow (SO) survey
\citep{StackoverflowSurvey2017,StackoverflowSurvey2018,StackoverflowSurvey2019,StackoverflowSurvey2020}
(in Stack Overflow 8\% respondents marked them as female).} It is often said that
females are less represented in STEM. As the SE industry is directly related to
STEM, the claim may be true in the SE industry. Though our survey does not
represent the real scenario, the proportion of male and female participants
supports the claim of under-representation. To get an overview of the Bangladesh
SE industry by gender in Figure \ref{fig:gender and role}, we plotted the
participants' roles grouped by gender.

\bf{In terms of roles, the proportion of developers among female participants is
comparatively low than that of male participants. However, the scenario is the
opposite of the manager and team lead role.} \bf{Also, among ten different roles, female participants are holding only four types of roles. Our findings align with the survey result of Hussain et
al.\citep{Hussain2020}. However,  the result of the SO survey\citep{StackoverflowSurvey2020} is slightly different. In the SO survey, female respondents are mostly data scientists, business analysts, QA, and developer roles. A common theme in all surveys is the role of female
respondents in the QA.}

James et al.'s \citep{James2017} survey on male
and female software professionals found that men are more likely to be in senior
positions than women. We also observed a similar scenario. However, in our case, the observation is not statistically significant. \bf{James et al. \citep{James2017} also found that male software practitioners tend to be older than female practitioners and female practitioners tend to leave jobs in mid-career. We observe the same phenomena in Q2 and Q4, and the finding may be
true in Bangladesh.}

% James et al.\citep{James2017} found that female practitioners express less
% satisfaction with the spirit of teamwork inside the organization. They conclude
% that this characteristic would make male practitioners a key part of a good
% agile team. However, our findings differs from James et al. \citep{James2017} in Q6, we observed that our survey's female participants prefer the Agile methodology over other software development methodologies. However, development methodology selections are often performed
% by senior management. Thus, personal preferences can have minimal effect on this
% choice.

% In James et al. \citep{James2017} survey, neither male nor female was not dominating any
% particular technology field. However, in Q9 of Table \ref{table:analysis by
% gender} we observe female participants working on desktop, web, and mobile. As a
% small SE industry, cloud/IoT is considered a less secured field as job
% opportunities in these fields are small. It seems female participants tend to
% work in a more secure technology (in terms of a job opportunity) field.
