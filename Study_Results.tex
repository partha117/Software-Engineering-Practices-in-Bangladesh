% \section{Study Results}
% \subsection{Development Practices and Processes in Bangladesh (RQ1)}
% We divide this into four sub-questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item What software methodology are used in your project?
%     \item Which implementation technologies and tools are adopted by software
% development professionals?
% \item  What type of testing and deployment practices are used?
% \item How are the security and performance is ensured in a product of a company?
% \end{enumerate}
% \subsection{Comparison among countries (RQ2)}
% We do the comparison along the following dimensions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Development methods and practices
%     \item Implementation technologies
%     \item Quality assurance
%     \item Release and iterations
% \end{enumerate}

We have explored two research questions in this study. The first question focuses on the dimensions of software development practices and processes in Bangladesh. The second question compares those practices prevailing in Bangladesh with other regions to reveal the similarities and dissimilarities in software development methodologies.

\subsection{Development Practices and Processes in Bangladesh (RQ1)}
\label{RQ1}

We divide this into the following four sub-questions which explore software development practices and processes in Bangladesh in more detail.

\input{RQ1_Methodology}
\input{RQ1_Technology_and_Tools}
\input{RQ1_Testing_and_Deployment}
\input{RQ1_Security_Performance_Scalability}

\subsection{Comparison among countries (RQ2)}
\label{RQ2}

This section presents a comparative discussion on different dimensions of software development practices and processes among different regions of the world along with Bangladesh. We make the comparison along the following dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Development methods and practices
\item Implementation technologies
\item Quality assurance
\item Release and iterations
\end{itemize}

The following subsections describe these dimensions.
