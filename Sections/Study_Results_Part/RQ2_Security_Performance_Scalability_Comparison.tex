\subsubsection{Security measures}
\label{security_comparison}

3.64\% of our survey respondents reported not to use any security measures in their product. This practice is also prevalent in the Indian and Malaysian software industries. Bahl et al.\cite{Bahl2011} reported that due to misalignment with organization design, goal, and strategy in some Indian software firms, security measures are not practiced. In a study on  Malaysian developers, Farvin et al.\cite{Farvin2016} found that 31\% of respondents think it is not required to add security in requirement analysis of a product. Basharat et al.\cite{Basharat2013} reported a sense of false security in the small software industry, and standard security practices are hardly followed. This can be one reason why some Bangladesh software industry respondents do not use any security measures.  From the response of a survey on the Turkey software industry, Garousi et al.\cite{Garousi2015} ranked types of design activities in terms of frequency. In that rank, security architecture was ranked second out of five. The ranking represents that security architecture is not a frequent activity in the Turkish software industry. However, in our survey, a very few (2.19\%) respondents reported practicing security architecture.  Bangladesh, the Turkish, and the New Zealand software industry have a resemblance in the practice of security testing. Garousi et al.\cite{Garousi2015} reported that security testing is least widely used among all kinds of testing ( e.g., unit testing, integration testing). Sung et al.\cite{Sung2006} found that in the New Zealand software industry, security testing and recovery testing practices are negligible compared to functional testing. The scenario is the same for Bangladesh; we found that 6.57\% of respondents reported security testing to ensure security.


\subsubsection{Performance measures}
\label{performance_comparison}
8.76\% of respondents of our survey use performance testing to ensure the performance of their product. However, it is the second least practiced measure among all the measures. Garousi et al.\cite{Garousi2015} found that in the Turkish software industry, developers mark the lack of performance testing as the main challenge in software maintenance. However, the scenario is different for the Canadian software industry. Participants of the survey of Garousi et al.\cite{Garousi2013} reported that 40\% of them conduct performance testing, and 30\% of their total testing effort is spent on performance testing. The New Zealand software industry follows the Canadian practice. Phillips et al.\cite{Phillips2003} reported that performance testing is a common testing practice in New Zealand. However, the practice of the Bangladeshi software industry matches the practices of the Pakistan software industry. In Pakistan software industry, performance testing is hardly practiced. In the survey of Shah Jahan et al.\cite{Jahan2019}, only 5\% of participants reported conducting performance testing. It seems that performance testing is less popular in growing software industries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Peer review is the least practiced measure in the Bangladesh SE industry. However, in the Turkish SE industry, peer review is ranked as the most frequent activity\cite{Garousi2015} (ranked five on a five-point Likert scale). Though the practice is only limited to code review. In architecture/design review is  hardly practiced in turkey (ranked one in a five-point Likert scale). The practice of peer review matches with Bangladesh. Only 2.92\% of participants reported practicing peer review.

\subsubsection{Scalability measures}
\label{scalability_comparison}
There is no study focusing on scalability practices in specific software industries, so it is difficult to compare scalability practices. However, in a study on Finnish DevOps, Laihonen\cite{Laihonen2018} found that the Finnish software industry prefers cloud services as it helps them automate quality insurance. He also reported that DevOps are inclined towards micro-service architecture when selecting a product rather than monolith architecture. Hussain et al.\cite{Hussain2017} conducted a study to identify trends in the DevOps practices in New Zealand. For this study, besides interviewing the DevOps', they examined the job advertisements for a DevOps role. They found that containerization technologies (e,g.; Docker, Kubernetes) have a high demand in the New Zealand software industry. 94\% of job advertisement requires expertise in one or multiple containerization technologies. This indicates the popularity of docker technology in the New Zealand software industry. However, in the Bangladesh SE industry, the scenario is different. Cloud services are the second most popular (10.95\%)  measure to ensure scalability where the use of containerization technologies are not that much popular (1.46\%)
