\subsubsection{Implementation technologies and tools}
\label{implementaion_techonologies}

To find out the overall comparison of this section, we report the following sub-sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Technology Platform (Q 9).
\item Operating System (Q 10).
\item Programming Language (Q 11).
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Technology Platforms}
As shown in \ref{fig:platforms}, most of the respondents (80\%) worked in web platform. Most respondents develop products and services for web platforms in both Bangladesh and New Zealand based on \cite{Wang2018}.

\paragraph{Operating Systems}
Windows is mostly used among developers of New Zealand based on the survey \cite{Wang2018}, but Linux is mostly used in the case for Bangladeshi developers.

\paragraph{Programming Languages}
Based on \cite{Wang2018}, Java ranks quite low in New Zealand where it is the second most used in Bangladesh and the mostly used language in Turkey \cite{Garousi2015}. Again, python did not get a respective place in the rank of used languages in New Zealand but it is used significantly in Bangladesh.
