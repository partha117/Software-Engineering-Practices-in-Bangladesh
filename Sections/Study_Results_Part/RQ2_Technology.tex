\subsubsection{Implementation technologies and tools}
\label{implementaion_techonologies_comparison}

To find out the overall comparison of this section, we report the following sub-sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Technology Platform (Q 9).
\item Operating System (Q 10).
\item Programming Language (Q 11).
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Technology Platforms}
As shown in \ref{fig:platforms}, most of our survey respondents (80\%) work in web platforms. This outcome is similar with the result of the survey of Wang et al. \cite{Wang2018} in which the authors found that most of their respondents also develop in web platforms in New Zealand.


\paragraph{Operating Systems}
We have found an interesting point that Windows is mostly used among developers of New Zealand based on the study \cite{Wang2018} nevertheless Linux is mostly used in the case for Bangladeshi developers corresponding to our survey presented in \ref{fig:os}.


\paragraph{Programming Languages}
According to the study of Wang et al.\cite{Wang2018}, Java ranks quite low in New Zealand nevertheless it is the second most used in Bangladesh as per our study reported in \ref{fig:languages} and the mostly used language in Turkey \cite{Garousi2015}. Again, python did not get a respective place in the rank of used languages in New Zealand nevertheless it is used significantly in Bangladesh.
