(1) Majority of our participants were related to the various types of web-based applications which conveys the market demand of web-based apps in Bangladesh. (2) Linux is mainly used for development purpose while macOS is highly preferred by managers. (3) Javascript and Java are two mostly used programming languages in Bangladesh SE industry since the demand of web-based services as well as mobile apps.
