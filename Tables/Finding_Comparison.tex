A handful of participants reported practicing `no security'. However, security architecture and security testing as a security measure are not prevalent in the Bangladesh SE industry. (2) Performance testing and peer review are the two least practiced performance measure in the Bangladesh SE industry. (3) Cloud service and architecture are two of the top three scalability measures. However, containerization technologies are not very popular in Bangladesh.
