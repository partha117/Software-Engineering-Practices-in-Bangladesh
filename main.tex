\begin{abstract}%\textbf{\it{Context:}}
Software development is complicated with rapidly changing requirements, techniques, processes and 
the involvement of diverse stakeholders. 
A study on the software development practice in a country
can reveal the challenges and scopes of improvement for countries of similar types. There are several studies on the software industry
of developed countries (e.g., European countries, Canada, 
New Zealand, etc.). To the best of our knowledge, no recent study explores the software development practices and challenges
in an emerging country. 
%\textbf{\it{Objective:}} 
We focus on understanding the challenges and
opportunities within the software companies of Bangladesh, which is an emerging
developing country with a large group of skilled software practitioners. We have
two objectives. First, we aim to understand the methods and practices 
adopted and challenges faced by the software companies in an emerging
country like Bangladesh. Second, we aim  to understand whether and how the development practices
and methods in Bangladesh differ from other countries. The comparison informs us
of the uniqueness of software industries in emerging countries like Bangladesh.
%\textbf{\it{Method:}} 
Our study has four phases. First, we conduct a series of
semi-structured interviews with eight individual practitioners from four
software companies. The purpose is to understand the overall development
practices and methods. Second, we use the insights gained from the first phase
to design a survey. A total of 137 software practitioners from a diverse set of
companies responded to the survey. Third, we analyze the survey responses to learn about the development 
practices in Bangladesh. Fourth, we compare our findings against findings previously reported for other countries (e.g., European countries, Canada, 
New Zealand, etc.).
%\textbf{\it{Results:}} 
The major findings on the companies of
Bangladesh software industry are: i) Most companies follow agile methodology
and give implementation-related activities a high priority, ii) Most companies
develop web-based software, iii) Most companies use less
automated testing and deployment tools, but iv) Several companies seriously
consider the security, performance, and scalability of their software. 
The development practices in Bangladesh are mostly similar to other developing countries (e.g., Malaysia), but differ from 
those in developed countries (e.g., Japan, Canada, Europe, etc.). For example, due to the mostly outsourcing nature of work carried in Bangladesh, 
overall system design is not as highly practised. 
Automated testing is also is not as widely practiced in Bangladesh as the developed countries, partly due to the difficulty of 
testing web-based systems which are mostly developed in Bangladesh. %\textbf{\it{Conclusions:}} 
The findings 
can guide software practitioners to improve development practices in emerging countries and software 
providers with new new tool support to assist in the process. In particular, more emphasis can 
be placed upon promoting overall system design and automated testing in the software industries of emerging countries.
