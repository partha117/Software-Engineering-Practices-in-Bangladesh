(1) The practice of security architecture and security testing as a security measure are not prevalent in the Bangladesh SE industry. (2) Performance testing and peer review are the two least practiced performance measure in the Bangladesh SE industry. (3) Cloud service and architecture are two of the top three scalability measures.

\vspace{13pt} Security testing is found to be the least practiced in the software industry in Turkey\citep{Garousi2015}, Malaysia\citep{Farvin2016}, India\citep{Bahl2011}, and New Zealand\citep{Sung2006}

We found that the practice of `no security' measures is less in Bangladesh compared to other countries. Though the practice of security testing Bangladesh has similarities with other countries, it lags behind the practices of matured industries. However, like the matured and grown software industries, cloud service is a popular measure in Bangladesh.
