\subsection{Analysis by Professions}
\label{analyze_by_professions}
% summarize key findings by professions. see Section 7.2 of \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8658125}
% In Tables \ref{table:analysis by profession part1}, \ref{table:analysis by
% profession part2}, and \ref{table:analysis by profession part3}, we summarize
% the interesting results of the closed questions by the reported roles of our survey participants. 
% For all questions, we reported the top values for each role. For
% example, for the question `Which of the following do you use for requirements
% gathering?' in Table \ref{table:analysis by profession part1}, we reported Plain
% Text for the developer's role. 26.2\% of software engineers use plain text for
% requirement gathering. Of all the other processes used by developers, the most
% commonly used requirement gathering process is plain text.

% % \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
% %   \item Multiple Choice Questions. If the question has two options (Male, Female), we only show the result of the option(s) with the majority agreement.
% %   \item For all other questions, we reported the top two values for each role. For example, for the question ‘Which of the following do you use for requirements gathering?’ in Table \ref{table:analysis by profession part1}, we reported PT (Plain Text) and SB (Story Board) for the software engineer's role. 26.2\% of software engineers use PT, and 22.99\% use SB. These two requirements gathering processes are the top two among all the other processes used by software engineers.

\bf{Agile is the most practiced requirement gathering method. The popularity of the Agile method is consistent across the different reported roles in our surveys.} The second popular method is Scrum.

In Q8, participants were asked to identify the SDLC activity, where most of the time is spent. Generally, it is expected that participants in the senior role (e.g., manager, team lead) will spend time in requirement analysis, documentation where participants in the junior role (e.g., developers, r\&d engineer) will spend time in implementation and testing. However, Q8's responses do not match our expectations. \bf{Across all roles, implementation is the most time spent activity in SDLC. However, testing is not considered one of the most time-consuming activities. Rigorous testing practices may not be prevalent in the Bangladesh SE industry.}
In most of the roles, Java is the most used languages (Java is the second most used language in cases where JavaScript is the most used language). Even in the data engineer role, Java is the most used language, though Python is mostly used in data processing. Like Java, Spring (one framework of Java) is the widely used framework regardless of role.
\bf{Java and JavaScript are the most used languages regardless of role.}
We observed from Q15 and Q13 that developers practice the highest level of automated testing, and developers mostly practice unit tests. One of the reasons for the high level of automated testing among developers may be that it is easier to achieve automated testing in unit testing due to different frameworks/libraries. Automated tests offering libraries/frameworks for other types of testing can encourage higher automated testing levels in other roles.
\bf{Developers mostly practice the highest level of automated testing. Automated testing frameworks for other types of testings may increase the practice of automated testing.}
